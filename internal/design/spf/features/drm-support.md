# DRM support

Digital Rights Management for protected content via the W3C
Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) specification. Covers MediaKeys /
MediaKeySession lifecycle, license-server interaction, key delivery,
and the per-key-system specifics for Widevine, PlayReady, and
FairPlay. The cluster F foundation that consumer-facing protected-
playback features (e.g., a Mux Player `drm-token` integration) build
on.

A **Media-src feature** in the framing from
[clusters.md § Feature classification axes](./clusters.md#feature-classification-axes):
without it, DRM-protected sources don't play. The engine has to set
up MediaKeys, negotiate a MediaKeySession, fetch and respond to
licenses, and deliver keys before the browser will decrypt segments.
*Which* key systems are supported is owned by
[capability-probing](./capability-probing.md) (cluster D); *setting
up* the chosen key system is owned by this feature.

Tracked via **[GitHub issue #1776](https://github.com/videojs/v10/issues/1776)**
("Feature: SPF DRM"). The non-SPF DRM work that once shared this doc's
tracking epic has shipped and is now prior art:
[#1411](https://github.com/videojs/v10/issues/1411) (retitled "DRM API for
Legacy Engine Medias"), [#1772 hls.js](https://github.com/videojs/v10/issues/1772),
[#1775 Mux integration](https://github.com/videojs/v10/issues/1775), and the
per-key-system sub-issues
[#1412](https://github.com/videojs/v10/issues/1412)–[#1414](https://github.com/videojs/v10/issues/1414)
(all closed). Milestone: GA. Prior art: the in-repo `@videojs/media` DRM
modules (`core/drm.ts` contract, `dom/hls-js/drm.ts` bridge,
`dom/native-hls/fairplay.ts` EME implementation, `dom/mux/drm.ts`
token-derived license URLs),
[videojs-contrib-eme](https://github.com/videojs/videojs-contrib-eme)
(Video.js v8 plugin), [Mux Player DRM integration](https://www.mux.com/docs/guides/protect-videos-with-drm)
(Widevine + PlayReady + FairPlay via `drm-token` attribute).

## Status

- **Composition:** not implemented in `createHlsVideoEngine`. No
  decryption pipeline: nothing sets up MediaKeys, negotiates a session,
  or requests a license. What exists is the *refusal* —
  `parseMediaPlaylist` recognizes `#EXT-X-KEY` well enough to flag a
  rendition `encrypted`, `canPlayTrack` prunes those renditions, and a
  fully-encrypted type reports `SVTA_UNSUPPORTED_DRM_SYSTEM` ("this
  video is protected") rather than a generic unsupported-format error.
  `#EXT-X-SESSION-KEY` is still unrecognized, which matters: Mux emits
  no session-key tag in the multivariant playlist, so encryption is
  undiscoverable until a media playlist is fetched — hence pruning at
  resolve time rather than at manifest parse.
- **Consumer contract already landed:** `source.drm` is typed by
  `@videojs/media`'s `DrmSystemsConfig` (`packages/media/src/core/drm.ts`) —
  license servers keyed by EME key-system id, `licenseUrl` + optional
  `serverCertificateUrl` — and is already consumed by the hls.js bridge
  (`dom/hls-js/drm.ts`), the native FairPlay implementation
  (`dom/native-hls/fairplay.ts` + `fairplay-webkit.ts`, including a DRM
  error taxonomy), and the Mux token derivation (`dom/mux/drm.ts`, one DRM
  token → all three systems' URLs). The SPF `mux-video` adapter accepts
  `source.drm` but leaves it inert, steering DRM sources to the
  hls.js-backed Media via `alternativeMediaSuggestion`. A Mux DRM CMAF
  playlist fixture (Widevine PSSH + PlayReady PRO + FairPlay `skd://`, all
  `METHOD=SAMPLE-AES`) exists at
  `packages/spf/src/media/hls/tests/fixtures/drm-cmaf-video.m3u8`.
- **Definition depth:** coarse — scope identified from GitHub issue
  + prior art (including a 2026-08 survey of hls.js, Shaka, dash.js,
  and rx-player DRM architecture); SPF touchpoints sketched at the
  cluster level; no implementation.
- **Hard prerequisite:** [capability-probing](./capability-probing.md)'s
  "Key-system capability probing" phase. The probe must resolve
  before this feature commits to a key system, sets up MediaKeys,
  or fetches a license. Crisp boundary per
  [clusters.md § Encrypted media (DRM)](./clusters.md#encrypted-media-drm):
  probing answers "can we?"; this feature answers "set it up."

## Phases of complexity

Scope slices around the implementation layers. Per-key-system
specifics are listed within a single phase row rather than as
separate phases.

| Phase | What | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| EME setup pipeline | Capability-probing's key-system verdict drives `navigator.requestMediaKeySystemAccess(...)`, which produces a `MediaKeys` instance attached via `mediaElement.setMediaKeys(mediaKeys)`. Ordering relative to MediaSource attachment is **not** spec-constrained the way this doc once claimed: Shaka and rx-player attach MediaKeys *after* `src`/MediaSource is linked (rx-player documents that ordering), hls.js gates fragment *loads* rather than MSE setup, dash.js gates nothing. The functional invariant is only that keys exist before encrypted data must decode. Sessions start manifest-driven (`MediaKeySession.generateRequest` with playlist-derived init data), with the `encrypted` event as fallback | Shared infrastructure regardless of key system. The SPF composition question is where the readiness gate composes — see Likely cross-cutting impact; the lean is a gate on the segment-load path, leaving `setupMediaSource` untouched in every variant |
| License flow | Per-source license-server configuration via the landed `DrmSystemsConfig` contract (`licenseUrl` + optional `serverCertificateUrl` per key system). `MediaKeySession.message` event → POST message to server → `MediaKeySession.update(licenseResponse)`. Per-key-system request/response quirks (PlayReady challenge-unwrap, FairPlay SPC/CKC bodies) live in internal adapters, as every surveyed engine does | The consumer contract is settled: `source.drm` (`packages/media/src/core/drm.ts`), already how Mux, hls.js, and native FairPlay are configured. Callback hooks (`licenseXhrSetup`-style request/response shaping) are deferred until a concrete need |
| Per-key-system specifics | Widevine, PlayReady, FairPlay. Per-system: init-data format (PSSH for Widevine, PRO box for PlayReady, content-id derivation for FairPlay), license URL conventions, license body format, server-certificate handshake (FairPlay), browser-API quirks. **FairPlay-AirPlay is a distinct key system from standard FairPlay** (see [capability-probing](./capability-probing.md)'s four-key-system enumeration) — active when content streams via AirPlay; entering/exiting AirPlay mid-playback is a *runtime state change*, not a compose-time variant, raising an open question on runtime-switching shape (see Open questions) | The shared pipeline + license flow above handle most of the machinery; each key system adds its own init-data + license-format adapters. In-repo references: `dom/native-hls/fairplay.ts` (FairPlay SPC/CKC + certificate handshake); the Mux fixture shows Widevine/PlayReady keys arriving as complete PSSH / PRO `data:` URIs in `#EXT-X-KEY`. FairPlay-AirPlay sits as a runtime-switchable variant of FairPlay specifically |
| Key delivery and `keystatuschange` reactivity | Browser receives keys via `MediaKeySession.update()`; encrypted segments decrypt automatically. `MediaKeySession.keystatuses` Map tracks per-key status (`usable`, `expired`, `output-restricted`, `released`, etc.); `keystatuschange` event fires on changes. Engine reacts to status transitions (e.g., expired key → re-request) | Tier 2-ish: engine can ignore non-`usable` statuses initially (key expiry surfaces as a playback failure); richer handling is consumer-policy-driven. Prior-art consensus (hls.js, Shaka, dash.js, rx-player): `output-restricted` / `internal-error` map to rendition-level exclusion, never a fatal error — SPF's constraint+filter pattern beside `excludeUnplayableTracks` |
| Security-level capability and constraint filtering | Probe device security level (Widevine L1 hardware-backed / L2 hybrid / L3 software-only; PlayReady SL150 / SL2000 / SL3000; FairPlay key-duration / persistent-vs-streaming model) via `MediaKeySystemAccess.getConfiguration()`. HDCP output-protection requirements similarly probed. Match against per-rendition security-level requirements (e.g., 4K HDR HEVC often requires L1 Widevine) and license-server policy. Write a `deviceSecurityLevel` constraint slot read by ABR / variant selection; renditions exceeding the device's level filter out, or the engine surfaces a failure when no compatible rendition remains | Constraint+filter pattern parallel to [rendition-selection-caps](./rendition-selection-caps.md) and [hevc-variant-selection](./hevc-variant-selection.md). Probing extends [capability-probing](./capability-probing.md)'s key-system probe with security-level configuration. Borderline classification (Media-src for "play protected content correctly"; Player for customer-policy caps) — current scope leans Media-src |
| Parser surface for key tags | `parseMediaPlaylist` surfaces structured key metadata (METHOD / KEYFORMAT / URI / KEYID) from `#EXT-X-KEY`, replacing today's boolean `encrypted` flag; multivariant parser surfaces `#EXT-X-SESSION-KEY` at presentation resolution. For Widevine / PlayReady the key URI is a `data:` URI carrying a complete PSSH / PRO (Mux emits this), so manifest-driven init data flows from the parsed-track output to the EME pipeline | Parser-side change. Today `#EXT-X-KEY` is recognized only enough to flag a rendition `encrypted`; the structured detail is dropped and `#EXT-X-SESSION-KEY` is unrecognized |
| Encrypted-event handling on `SourceBuffer` / mediaElement | `encrypted` event on `mediaElement` triggers session creation via init-data. Once keys are delivered, segment-append proceeds normally; the engine doesn't intervene per-segment | Cross-cluster MSE concern; segment-append flow is unchanged for encrypted streams aside from the key-readiness gate |

## What's in scope vs out of scope

**In scope:**
- All seven phases above for HLS protected content with EME-supported
  key systems (Widevine, PlayReady, FairPlay)
- MediaKeys / MediaKeySession lifecycle management (per-source setup,
  source-change cleanup)
- License fetcher with consumer-pluggable URL / headers / body
  transformation hooks
- Parser surface for `#EXT-X-KEY` and `#EXT-X-SESSION-KEY` tags
- `keystatuschange` event reactivity baseline (surface failures)
- Engine-composition variant for DRM-required content
- Security-level probing extension to capability-probing's key-system
  probe (returns supported security levels per key system via
  `MediaKeySystemAccess.getConfiguration()`)
- Security-level constraint slot (`deviceSecurityLevel`) + filter-
  pattern integration with rendition selection (parallel to
  `userVideoTrackSelection` in video-abr.md and per-cap slots in
  rendition-selection-caps.md)
- HDCP output-protection requirement detection and gating

**Out of scope (separate Media-src candidate features):**
- **Key-system capability probing** — owned by
  [capability-probing](./capability-probing.md). Crisp boundary:
  probing answers "can we?"; this feature answers "set it up."

**Out of scope (different architectural layer):**
- Adapter-layer customer-facing API surfaces (e.g., a Mux Player
  `drm-token` attribute, a consumer-passed license-server URL config).
  The SPF feature owns the engine-side license fetcher with pluggable
  hooks; the adapter / consumer provides the actual URL, headers,
  authentication tokens. videojs-contrib-eme's `keySystems` config
  shape is one reference for the consumer surface.
- License-server hosting and DRM token signing. Service-side concerns.
- Per-device key-system installation, content-decryption-module
  updates. Browser / OS responsibilities.
- DRM error UX (license expired, output not permitted) above the
  engine. Engine surfaces failures; adapter renders UX.

## Likely cross-cutting impact

Things this feature probably forces decisions on, not just additions:

- **Key-readiness gate placement — composition-variant placement.**
  The functional requirement is that keys are available before
  encrypted data must decode; no surveyed engine gates MediaSource
  attachment on MediaKeys. Prior art: Shaka sets `video.src` first and
  calls `setMediaKeys()` after (deferring further for FairPlay);
  rx-player attaches MediaKeys only once the MediaSource is linked and
  blocks segment push until then; hls.js gates fragment loads on key
  readiness (including the last clear fragment before an `#EXT-X-KEY`
  boundary); dash.js gates nothing and lets the element stall. Today's
  MSE gates per [mse-mms-pipeline.md](./mse-mms-pipeline.md):
  MediaElement + presentation URL + `'open'` readyState gate
  `setupMediaSource`; resolved track + open MediaSource gate
  `setupSourceBuffers`. Per the failure-mode catalog's composition-
  variant entry: variant-specific behaviors compose into DRM-required
  engine variants, not as runtime branches in always-on behaviors.
  Three shapes:
  - **(a)** DRM-required engine variant composes a *different*
    `setupMediaSource` that gates on a `mediaKeysReady` signal before
    attaching; standard `setupMediaSource` composes into non-DRM
    engines unchanged.
  - **(b)** A new `setupMediaKeys` behavior writes to a generic
    "ready-to-attach" gate slot that `setupMediaSource` reads;
    standard engines provide a default-true writer for the slot.
  - **(c)** `setupMediaSource` is untouched in every variant; the DRM
    variant composes the gate on the **segment-load path** (an FSM
    precondition on `mediaKeysReady` in the load behaviors), mirroring
    hls.js's fragment-load gate and rx-player's push-block, and
    matching the existing gate-shape convention (FSM precondition
    state with `monitor`-driven exit).
  Lean: (c) — it keeps the non-DRM composition genuinely unchanged
  *and* gates at the point the invariant actually protects.
  Beyond that gate, additional DRM gates fire downstream:
  capability-probing's key-system verdict (Tier 1 gate, fires once
  per source); per-session license obtained + `keystatuschange`
  confirms at least one `usable` key (fires on key delivery,
  decryption is async beyond this gate).
- **Composition variant for DRM-required content.** DRM-required
  engine variants compose additional behaviors (MediaKeys setup,
  license fetcher, encrypted-event handler) atop the standard
  composition; DRM-free engines don't carry the machinery. Same
  shape as the live / DVR / LL-HLS variant pattern. The decision
  point — does the consumer opt into a DRM variant upfront, or does
  the engine detect DRM from `#EXT-X-KEY` / `#EXT-X-SESSION-KEY`
  parser output and route accordingly — is open. Adapter-upfront
  is simpler; detect-and-route is more adaptive.
- **State slots for DRM lifecycle.** New slots likely include:
  `drmReady` (key system probed + MediaKeys attached + license
  obtained), `mediaKeysReady` (intermediate gate), and possibly
  per-session state for license-renewal scenarios. Multi-writer
  characterization is open until the slot family solidifies.
- **Encrypted-segment buffer behavior.** Once keys are delivered,
  the MSE pipeline appends encrypted segments unchanged. The
  encrypted-event flow happens *before* steady-state appending. No
  per-segment decrypt overhead from the engine's perspective; the
  browser handles decryption transparently. The MSE codec-change
  check does not fire — DRM doesn't change codec.
- **Source-replacement cascade under DRM.** When the consumer
  changes `presentation.url`, the existing MediaKeys / MediaKeySession
  tear down; the new source's DRM setup runs fresh. Standard
  resolved/unresolved cascade per
  [source-replacement.md](./source-replacement.md), with MediaKeys
  cleanup as an additional in-place cleanup target.
- **License-fetcher composability.** The consumer contract is settled:
  `source.drm`'s `DrmSystemsConfig` (`packages/media/src/core/drm.ts`) —
  declarative license-server URLs per key system — already describes
  Mux (`createMuxDrmSystems` derives every URL from one DRM token),
  hls.js, and native FairPlay. Per-key-system body/header quirks live
  in internal adapters. Pluggable request/response hooks
  (videojs-contrib-eme's `getLicense`, hls.js's `licenseXhrSetup`) are
  deferred until a concrete consumer need; nothing in the Mux path
  requires them.
- **Per-key-system browser-API differences.** Widevine, PlayReady,
  FairPlay all have spec-compliant EME surfaces, but the
  init-data formats, license-message formats, server-certificate
  handshakes, and key-status semantics differ. Per-key-system adapter
  modules (one per sub-issue) handle the system-specific logic; the
  shared EME pipeline calls into them via a uniform interface.

## Open questions

- **Variant-decision signal source.** Adapter-upfront opt-in (consumer
  knows the source is DRM-protected, instantiates a DRM-capable
  engine variant) vs detect-from-parser (engine sees `#EXT-X-KEY` and
  routes to DRM-capable composition). Adapter-upfront is simpler;
  detect-and-route is more adaptive but adds composition-time-
  decision complexity.
- **Composition-variant shape for the key-readiness gate.** Per the
  cross-cutting note: variant `setupMediaSource` (a) vs generic
  ready-to-attach slot (b) vs segment-load-path gate (c). The
  prior-art survey removed the premise that `setMediaKeys` must
  precede MediaSource attachment, which is what made (a) attractive.
  Lean: (c) — confirm against the load behaviors' FSM shape when
  implementation starts.
- **FairPlay-AirPlay runtime switching.** AirPlay session state is
  a *runtime* condition (user can enter/exit AirPlay during
  playback), not a compose-time variant. This breaks the standard
  composition-variant discipline (compose-time variants for compose-
  time conditions). Two open shapes: (a) a middle-pattern behavior
  monitors AirPlay session state (`mediaElement.remote.state` or
  equivalent) and writes an `airplaySessionActive` slot; a DRM-variant
  behavior reads the slot and reacts (re-request key system,
  re-create MediaKeys, potentially flush buffer + re-fetch license).
  MediaKeys-recreation mid-source is non-trivial — the standard
  source-replacement cascade tears MediaKeys down on
  `presentation.url` change; an AirPlay-triggered recreation would
  need a narrower reset (MediaKeys only, not the rest of the source
  state). (b) Defer the switch entirely: standard FairPlay key system
  is used for both local and AirPlay playback, accepting any degraded
  behavior or playback errors during AirPlay sessions. Likely (a)
  but the implementation is substantial; this open question may
  itself motivate a follow-on feature doc once this feature's FairPlay
  phase lands.
- **MediaKeys re-use across sources.** When the consumer changes
  sources within the same key system + license server, should the
  engine re-use the existing MediaKeys instance or tear down and
  recreate? Re-use saves the `requestMediaKeySystemAccess` cost but
  complicates lifecycle. Prior art splits: rx-player re-uses via a
  WeakMap-keyed attacher (MediaKeys + session cache across loads,
  guarded by config compatibility); hls.js tears down per manifest,
  serializing CDM cleanup across instances through a static promise;
  videojs-contrib-eme tears down per-source. Lean: teardown-per-source
  initially (matches the resolved/unresolved cleanup cascade); re-use
  is an optimization with prior art when needed.
- **`keystatuschange` reactivity policy.** Engine-baseline behavior on
  key-status transitions (expired, output-restricted, released, etc.).
  Surface as a state-error slot? Trigger automatic re-request? Defer
  to consumer? Defaulting matters because keystatus changes can fire
  mid-playback.
- **Init-data extraction location.** Partially resolved by prior art +
  Mux's manifests: for Widevine and PlayReady the `#EXT-X-KEY` URI is
  a `data:` URI carrying a complete PSSH / PRO (hls.js uses it as-is),
  so parser-side manifest-driven init data is the primary path and the
  `encrypted` event is the fallback; FairPlay's `skd://` URI has no
  playlist init data, so it stays event-driven (`sinf`). Residual:
  where the fallback listener lives and how the two paths dedupe
  sessions.
- **Cross-feature: DRM + live / DRM + DVR.** Live and DVR streams
  with DRM are valid use cases. The reload-loop interacts with key
  renewal cadence (if licenses expire during a long live session,
  the reload-loop + license-fetcher may both need re-trigger logic).
  Cross-cluster A + F open question; resolution likely after both
  clusters have implementation work.
- **Output-protection-aware ABR coordination.** Renditions tagged
  with security-level / HDCP requirements interact with video-ABR
  and hevc-variant-selection. ABR's candidate set should be filtered
  by the `deviceSecurityLevel` constraint slot before bandwidth-
  driven selection runs. Filter ordering: capability filter
  (physics) → policy caps → security-level → bandwidth-driven
  selection. Per-rendition requirement tagging is open: parser-
  surfaced HLS extension attributes vs runtime-probed via license-
  server policy vs both. Server-side conventions vary.
- **Per-rendition security-level tag surface.** HLS doesn't have a
  spec-defined attribute for "this rendition requires L1 Widevine."
  Providers commonly encode the requirement in proprietary attributes
  (`URI-SECURITY-LEVEL`, etc.) or imply it from `RESOLUTION` thresholds
  (4K+ requires hardware DRM by convention on many platforms). Parser
  needs an extension axis for surfacing the requirement; license-
  server policy is the orthogonal source.
