/**
 * SVTA 2070 (Standardized Error Codes) — the vocabulary for identifying a
 * playback failure or notice, independent of how it's transported or who
 * decides what to do about it.
 *
 * A code is a single integer: the leading digit(s) are the **category** (the
 * error's domain) and the trailing three are the **index** (the specific error
 * within it). Four digits for natively-defined errors, five when an external
 * standard is embedded — `"03404"` is an HTTP 404 under the network category.
 * Categories are `0` unknown, `1` media content, `2` playback, `3` network,
 * `4` content protection, `5` accessibility, `6` remote play, `7` advertising,
 * `99` custom.
 *
 * Two properties of the spec shape the types here:
 *
 * - **Severity is deliberately not part of a code.** Per §Approach, "impact
 *   varies with player implementation, breaking the consistency of a specific
 *   error mapping to single code." So an error carries no fatal flag — whether a
 *   condition is fatal depends on the composition observing it, and is decided
 *   downstream.
 * - **Reporting is partial and stacked** (Principles 5–6). Errors are reported
 *   as encountered, most of them non-fatal, and the *sequence* carries causation
 *   a single value can't.
 *
 * See `internal/design/spf/features/errors.md`.
