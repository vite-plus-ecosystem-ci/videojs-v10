/**
 * The Mux Media over the SPF HLS engine.
 *
 * Mirrors `@videojs/media/dom/mux`'s hls.js-backed `MuxMedia` — same class shape,
 * same `src`/`source` relationship, same derived `contentData` — over a different
 * engine, though named for the flavor rather than sharing that class's name. It
 * carries no `engine` or `preferPlayback`: SPF publishes no
 * engine-shaped config for a consumer to pass, so the source is Mux identity and
 * nothing else.
 *
 * `source.drm` licenses playback: a `drm.token` derives Mux's three license
 * servers, and entries naming servers outright override them. A source carrying
 * neither prunes its encrypted renditions and reports unsupported DRM, exactly
 * as an engine with no EME does.
