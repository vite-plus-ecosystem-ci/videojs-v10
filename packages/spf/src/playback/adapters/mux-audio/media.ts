/**
 * The Mux Media over the SPF audio-only HLS engine.
 *
 * Same Mux surface as the video flavor — `src`, the structured `source`, and the
 * derived `contentData` all come from the shared mixin — over the subtractive
 * engine, so only the audio renditions of whatever the playback ID names are
 * fetched. That is the one place this diverges from the hls.js-backed
 * `<mux-audio>`, which runs the full engine and downloads video renditions it
 * never shows.
 *
 * `source.drm` is accepted but inert, unlike on the video flavor: the audio-only
 * engine composes no EME. Mux encrypts video renditions and leaves audio clear,
 * so a protected playback ID still plays here.
 *
 * `contentData` is kept rather than dropped, for the same reason its hls.js
 * counterpart has it: a playback ID played as audio is usually a *video* asset,
 * whose poster and storyboard exist and which an audio skin may well want. The
 * element ignores it either way. Mux publishes neither for a genuinely
 * audio-only asset, so those URLs 404 — see the known shortcoming on the video
 * flavor, which shares the derivation.
