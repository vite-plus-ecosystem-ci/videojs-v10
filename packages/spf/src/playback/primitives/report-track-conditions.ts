/**
 * The seam `resolve-track` uses to report conditions discovered in a freshly
 * parsed media playlist.
 *
 * Injected rather than baked in so `resolve-track` stays free of format and
 * policy knowledge: it parses and commits, and whatever the composition wants
 * noticed about the result is this function's business. Which conditions matter,
 * and which codes they carry, therefore vary per composition — a provider that
 * never ships MPEG-TS can drop that check, and future playlist-derived notices
 * (LL-HLS or DVR support that's partial rather than absent) attach here without
 * touching the resolver.
 *
 * Reported **per rendition, as it resolves**, which is why these are causes and
 * not verdicts: one rendition being unplayable doesn't make the source
 * unplayable. The verdict is `track-switching`'s, which reports
 * `SVTA_NO_SUPPORTED_{VIDEO,AUDIO}_TRACK` when a type's candidates actually
 * empty. Keeping the two apart is what lets a mixed source — some renditions
 * encrypted or MPEG-TS, others playable — log its causes and still play.
